The dice rolling spec is whitespace-neutral (all whitespace is stripped before
the roll is parsed).

The Specification
=================
[<rolls>#]<dice-spec>

rolls
  Description
  ===========
  Positive integer, the number of results to generate.  If not present then
  1 roll is assumed.  This is affected by a hard-configured maximum.

dice-spec
  [+|-][<dice-group>][+|-|x|*|/][(][<dice-group>][+|-|x|/][<dice-group>][)] ...
  
  +|-
    Description
    ===========
    All rolls or modifiers may be positive or negative.  This may be omitted
    in the first dice specification in a chain (it is assumed that the roll
    is positive).
  
  +|-|x|*|/
    Description
    ===========
    Simple arithmetic may be performed on dicerolls.  These symbols represent
    addition, subtraction, multiplication and division respectively.  All dice
    groups must be separated by at least one of these symbols.  Operators are
    executed in the standard order of multiplication/division first, then
    addition/subtraction.
    Note that "*" and "x" are both acceptable synonyms for multiplication.
  
  ()
    Description
    ===========
    Parentheses surrounding dice groups cause them to be evaluated first, before
    any other modifiers.  Thus it is possible to alter the normal order of
    operators.
  
  dice-group
    x
      Description
      ===========
      Positive integer, if followed by the character "d" (case-insensitive)
      then this is the number of dice rolled.  If not followed by a "d"
      character then this represents a static modifier to the final result of
      the roll.  This is affected by a hard-configured maximum.
      
    y
      Description
      ===========
      Positive integer, the number of sides on the die to be rolled.  This is
      affected by a hard-configured maximum.  The percentage symbol: "%" is
      interpreted as a shorthand for "100".
    
    Description
    ===========
    A dice group is either a single integer (static number) or two integers
    separated with the "d" character (a dice roll).  All dice groups are
    evaluated into integers before they are combined using the operators that
    separate them.
  
  Description
  ===========
  The dice spec determines how a group of dice are rolled (or provides a static
  integer modifier).  A single roll may consist of one or more dice groups,
  separated by operators.  The number of dice groups allowed is affected by a
  hard-configured maimum.

Rules for Prsing Invalid Specification Strings
==============================================
If the following conditions are met, they are dealt with in the way listed:
* Too many opening brackets
> Any open brackets are implicitly closed at the end of the string

* Too many closing brackets
> Any extra ones are ignored/discarded

* Adjacent operation symbols
> Only the first operation encountered is used, the rest are discarded

* Multiplication/Division at the start of the string
> Throw an exception with an error message

* Number followed immediately by an open-bracket (without an operation)
> Throw an exception with an error message

* Invalid characters in the specification
> Discard any invalid characters and continue
